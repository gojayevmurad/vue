          In its new vehicle safety center, Audi subjects its vehicles to sophisticated crash tests
          to optimize them and increase safety standards – also taking into account the most
          demanding safety requirements used in the major markets of North America, China and
          Europe. A visit with the experts for crash tests and passive vehicle safety*.

          *Experts consider “active safety” to be all elements in a vehicle that could help prevent
          an accident. For example: brake system, active emergency brake systems, chassis, tires,
          automobile light technologies and driver assist system like Audi pre sense. “Passive
          safety” involves elements that can reduce the risk of injury or eliminate it entirely. It
          includes seat belts, airbags, stable passenger compartments and energy-dissipating vehicle
          structures.

          Plastic and metal are crushed. Fragments fly through the air. A cacophony of sounds – a
          brief creak, an ear-piercing screech and a dull thud – fills the huge hall, deafeningly
          loud, like a gunshot, just more intricate and muted. A moving barrier traveling at 80
          kilometers per hour rams the rear end of the white Audi Q8 e-tron, shoving it forward
          several meters. Then: standstill and silence. What’s left is a vehicle with a demolished
          rear end that can teach us a lot.

        <h3 class="text-4xl font-fjalla my-14 mb-6 text-center">Safety is Audi’s top priority</h3>
        <p class="text-3xl font-thin text-center">
          Survey after survey has shown that safety is one of customers’ top priorities when they
          purchase a vehicle. The issue has a broad range of facets to it: “Our ‘active safety’
          systems 4 can already help prevent accidents in individual cases,” Martin Friedrichsen
          says. “But you will still have situations in which accidents are unavoidable. This is
          where ‘passive safety’ 4 systems go to work. As a global premium manufacturer, we have
          made safety a very high priority. The company consciously invests in vehicle safety
          development, and we have been working from the very beginning on high standards designed
          to protect vehicle passengers.” This commitment has now become even more obvious at Audi:
          A new vehicle safety center in which Audi has combined all of its crash expertise has been
          opened on the site of the incampus in the east of Ingolstadt.

        <h3 class="text-4xl font-fjalla mt-14 mb-6 text-center">20,000 simulations – 1,100 real tests</h3>
        <p class="text-3xl font-thin text-center">
          The results of the rear-end crash test in the new hall have now been documented in detail.
          Even though the 220 vehicle-safety employees crashed about 1,100 vehicles in 2023 – along
          with conducting about 20,000 virtual accident simulations – the seconds that immediately
          precede and follow a crash are anything but routine. “In the blink of the eye, we see
          whether 85 years of crash-safety research and development pay off,” Martin Friedrichsen
          says. “As early as 1938, engineers of DKW, one of the four founding brands of today’s AUDI
          AG, conducted rollover and side-impact tests with DKW models. These are considered to be
          the first crash tests in the history of the automobile. Historic motion pictures taken at
          the time show how an engineer is able to easily open the door of an empty vehicle that has
          just rolled over several times.” The ability to open a door following a rollover accident
          remains a critically important factor to passengers and first responders today – decades
          later (VDA).
